### **About Me**  

Hello! I'm **Juan Yi**, it's pronounced *Jew-Aren't-E*. People usually just call 
me Johnny.

I'm a computer science and maths student at the University of Toronto. I'm 
actively dabbling in research and am hoping to explore the ever-hyped yet 
ever-interesting field of machine learning in the future. 

I'm using this website/blog to publish my thoughts on stuff I find interesting 
and anything that I think could be valuable for someone that, in their misfortune,
finds themselves reading my rambles. 


### **What\'s with your website title?**   
In countries with little Spanish influence (like Malaysia where I'm from), 
pronouncing the *J* silently in 'Juan' is uncommon. 

However, in North America, it becomes pretty amusing since pronouncing the *J* 
silently in 'Juan Yi' sounds like *换衣*, which roughly means 
*a change of clothes*.

To fix this, I have to consistently tell people that *the J is not silent*. I 
thought that it would be a pretty clever way to title my website/blog too.
