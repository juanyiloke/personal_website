### **About Me**

Hello! I'm **Juan Yi**. People usually just call 
me Johnny.

I'm a computer science and maths student at the University of Toronto.

I'm using this website/blog to publish my thoughts on stuff I find interesting.


### **What\'s with the title?**   
In countries with little Hispanic influence (like Malaysia where I'm from), 
pronouncing the *J* silently in 'Juan' is uncommon. 

However, in North America, it becomes pretty amusing since pronouncing the *J* 
silently in 'Juan Yi' sounds like *换衣*, which means *a change of clothes*.

To fix this, I consistently tell people that *the J is not silent*. I 
thought that it would be a pretty clever way to title my website/blog too.
