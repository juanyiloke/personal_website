#### So what is this blog about?
I plan to explore ideas that I have in my mind. Like everything else in life, I believe that
becoming better at something just means practising more at it. I like exploring interesting
ideas and I intend to use this as a means of keeping myself accountable with this practise.

#### Why now?
It's better late than never. I always wanted to write a public blog as my experience with
social media has forced me to yield to the 21st century mantra of "if it ain't recorded,
it didn't happen." So here I am. Recording down my thoughts with no agenda in mind. I guess I'll
start off with some stuff I'm interested in and see what this grows into.

#### So what will this grow into?
Who knows.

#### Why should anyone else read this?
I guess whatever this is will have two functions. In its pedagogical capacity, this practise will
help me reflect on my experiences and hopefully find a useful lesson from it. In its capacity as
a platform to communicate, I hope my writing is clear enough that one finds some value in reading
them.
